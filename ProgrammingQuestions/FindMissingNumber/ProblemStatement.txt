There is an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. 
Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array. [Linear searching is not allowed].
Sample Input:
Array a = [4, 1, 0, 2, 9, 6, 8, 7, 5, 3]
Array b = [4, 6, 7, 2, 1, 0, 8, 3, 9];
Output:
5
